# Demand Forecast Model

This repository contains the code and resources for developing a demand forecast model for the Surplus Food Distribution platform.

## Work in Progress

⚠️ **This project is in the early stages, and work has not started on the demand forecast model yet.**

The current focus is on data collection and preparation. Once sufficient data is collected, the demand forecast model development will commence. Please note that this README is a placeholder and will be updated with comprehensive documentation as the project progresses.

## Getting Started

As of now, there are no specific steps for setting up the demand forecast model, as development has not started. However, you can follow the general structure of the codebase, and dependencies will be updated accordingly when the development phase begins.

## Data Collection

Data collection is in progress. The model will utilize historical sales data, user engagement patterns, and other relevant information to forecast demand for surplus food items.

## Contributing

Contributions will be welcomed once the demand forecast model development begins. Feel free to check back later or express your interest in contributing.
